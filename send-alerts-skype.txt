Task: there are many servers at x company, all servers monitored with prometheus and grafana tools.
The manager asked me to implement receiving notification via skype if one of the server is down. This is the pretty simple task if research inet enough.
For this task I used this https://github.com/yurcn/prometheus-skype-alerts.git github project.

1) ssh into prometheus installed server, then install prometheus-alertmanager using apt repository.
2) mkdir /etc/prometheus/alert-rules
3) copy rules.yml /etc/prometheus/alert-rules/  # rules.yml file exists this git repo
4) open /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml and edit like below
    rule_files:
      - "alert-rules/rules.yml"

5) backup default alertmanager.yml file like this alertmanager.yml.bak
6) edit /etc/prometheus/alertmanager.yml, this file exists this git repo
7) git clone https://github.com/yurcn/prometheus-skype-alerts.git
8) create skype-config.yml file at cloned project root directory
9) open your browser, login to skype with your credentials, create group chat, name it anything you want
  write any text to that group, skype opened window, mouse right click, press inspect, and move to network section, there you must
  find group channel id like this 19:XXXX@thread.skype
10) open skype-config.yml and complete your credentail details with group channel id (this file also exists this git repo)
11) and run this project python3 prometheus-skype-alerts --config=skyp-config.yml
