Task: there are many servers at x company, all servers monitored with prometheus and grafana tools.
The manager asked me to implement receiving notification via skype if one of the server is down. This is the pretty simple task if research inet enough.
For this task I used this https://github.com/yurcn/prometheus-skype-alerts.git github project.

1) ssh into prometheus installed server, then install prometheus-alertmanager using apt repository.
2) mkdir /etc/prometheus/alert-rules
3) copy rules.yml /etc/prometheus/alert-rules/  # rules.yml file exists this git repo
4) open /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml and edit like below
    rule_files:
      - "alert-rules/rules.yml"

5) backup default alertmanager.yml file like this alertmanager.yml.bak
6) edit /etc/prometheus/alertmanager.yml, this file exists this git repo
7)
